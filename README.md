## Quiro-Graphic Dictionary of Brazilian Sign-Language  

The dictionary program allows searches using words and a set of graphical representations of Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS). So it's possible, for example, search for all the representations that uses two hands above the head. 

The original project was written in Object Pascal, using Delphi 6. This project aimed to rewrite the sign-language dictionary in Java, proving multiplatform capacity to the system. 
The application was written using Java 8, with the data stored into SQLite. The original database was Interbase,
so was necessary write code to export the data and import into SQLite. 
The user interface was created using Swing components.
